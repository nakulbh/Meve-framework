Sylvester Samuels better known by his stage name Lil Ru, is an American rapper from Ridgeway, South Carolina currently signed to Def Jam Recordings.
 His debut album, 21 & Up was released on August 25, 2009.
 The Ridgeway native was 16 when he made his professional foray into the music business.
 Inspired by New Orleans’ innovative Cash Money Crew, Ru began making a name for himself on his local music scene, doing live shows and pressing up his own CDs.
 His hard-hitting lyrics and entrepreneurial spirit caught the attention of fellow South Carolinian Angie Stone.
 Shortly after the neo-soul songstress helped him secure a deal with Elektra Records, Ru found himself unsigned again, among the artists lost in the shuffle after the label merged with Atlantic Records.
 Music fans first heard him on his 2001 debut single Will Destroy.
 He then released his 2002 follow up, Shawty What You Doin’.
 Both songs reached the Billboard R&B/Hip-Hop charts and helped land him at his next label home, Capitol Records.

 The song also accompanied the credits of the film "Johnny Mnemonic" and was included on the film's soundtrack, along with the song "Lost".

 Low-end universal remotes can only control a set number of devices determined by their manufacturer, while mid- and high-end universal remotes allow the user to program in new control codes to the remote.
 Many remotes sold with various electronic include universal remote capabilities for other types of devices, which allow the remote to control other devices beyond the device it came with.

In electronics, a remote control is a component of an electronic device used to operate the device wirelessly from a distance.
 For example, in consumer electronics, a remote control can be used to operate devices such as a television set, DVD player, or other home appliance, from a short distance.
 A remote control is primarily a convenience feature for the user, and can allow operation of devices that are out of convenient reach for direct operation of controls.
 In some cases, remote controls allow a person to operate a device that they otherwise would not be able to reach, as when a garage door opener is triggered from outside or when a Digital Light Processing projector that is mounted on a high ceiling is controlled by a person from the floor level.

**MeVe Raw Answer**: Context 1:
Kansas City Scout is one of the United States' largest electronic traffic management systems.
 It was created in 2000 as part of a bi-state initiative between the Missouri Department of Transportation and the Kansas Department of Transportation to provide this system for the Kansas City Metropolitan Area, which is in both Missouri and Kansas (the anchor city of Kansas City is in Missouri).
 The project's cost was $43 million.
 Of that amount, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) contributed 80-90 percent of the project cost.
 KDOT and MoDOT shared the remaining cost.
 The system employs a system of electronic boards placed on major highways throughout the metropolitan area that display traffic information whenever information needs to be displayed (due to an accident, lane closure, highway closure etc.), and the system also has cameras on those billboards to automatically detect traffic problems.
 While the system has extensive coverage of highways in the Kansas City Metropolitan Area it still has much more to cover.
 Since it would be too expensive to cover all the major highways in the Kansas City metro (which has more miles of highway per person than any other metropolitan area in the United States), studies were conducted to determine which highways or segments of highways have priority due to higher accident rates.
 Since the project's beginning, it has expanded greatly, and will continue to expand.
 Future plans are to extend coverage to I-635 and cover I-435 even more (especially in the northern areas of the metro) as well as other major city highways.
 It was named after the iconic Kansas City Scout Statue that exists in Penn Valley Park, overlooking Downtown Kansas City.
