**MeVe Raw Answer**: Context 1:
Tunnels & Trolls (abbreviated "T&T") is a fantasy role-playing game designed by Ken St. Andre and first published in 1975 by Flying Buffalo.
 The second modern role-playing game published, it was written by Ken St. Andre to be a more accessible alternative to "Dungeons & Dragons" and is suitable for solitaire, group, and play-by-mail gameplay.

Context 4:
Mercenaries, Spies and Private Eyes ("MSPE") is a tabletop role-playing game designed and written by Michael A. Stackpole and first published in April 1983 by Blade, a division of Flying Buffalo, Inc.
 A second edition was later published by Sleuth Publications, but Flying Buffalo continues to distribute the game.
 "MSPE"'s mechanics are based on those of "Tunnels and Trolls", with the addition of a skill system for characters.
 A few adventure modules were also released for "MSPE".
 The ruleset of 1987 video game "Wasteland", on which Michael A. Stackpole worked, is based on "MSPE"; as the upcoming 2013 sequel "Wasteland 2" will use similar mechanics, so it too can be seen as based on MSPE.

**MeVe Raw Answer**: Context 1:
Dewey Beard or Wasú Máza ("Iron Hail", 1858–1955) was a Minneconjou Lakota who fought in the Battle of Little Bighorn as a teenager.
 After George Armstrong Custer's defeat, Wasu Maza followed Sitting Bull into exile in Canada and then back to South Dakota where he lived on the Cheyenne River Indian Reservation.
 Chief Iron Hail is often mistaken by historians for Chief Iron Tail, being Lakota contemporaries with similar-sounding names.
 Most biographies incorrectly report that Chief Iron Tail fought in the Battle of the Little Bighorn and that his family was killed in 1890 at Wounded Knee, when in truth it was Chief Iron Hail who suffered the loss.
